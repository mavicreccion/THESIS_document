\begin{abstract}
Several traffic models were already developed to alleviate traffic congestion, while also considering the effect of weather. However, they were not designed and tested in countries with poor road infrastructures where other weather variables and their resulting natural disasters have some effect on the traffic condition. This research proposes a traffic prediction model that incorporates the aforementioned weather variables present in Manila, and other features that describe the trends in traffic and weather for both normal and disrupted periods. Following data analysis, it was observed that heavy rain disrupts the normal trend of traffic and that the collected weather variables have weak correlation with traffic. From such findings, features were engineered from traffic and weather to be used in the models, such as temporal information of traffic, previous and current traffic conditions, rolling and expanding features, working day and peak hour, and weather effects. A traffic-based model and weather-based model were implemented using DBN and RNN, while the fusion model at both feature and decision level were implemented using DBN, RNN, and WA using Least Square Estimate. The various combinations of features, the different fusion approaches and algorithms, and the sensitivity of the models were evaluated. Results show that the traffic-based prediction outperforms weather-based traffic prediction. Moreover, fusing at decision level have better results than fusing at fusion level. After implementing various fusion algorithms, it was found that RNN, especially at decision level, outperforms the other fusion algorithms.
