\begin{abstract}
Numerous traffic models have been developed to alleviate urban traffic congestion, while also considering weather variables such as temperature, wind gust, weather condition, and rainfall. However, while these traffic models do predict traffic congestion and have produced high accuracies, these models were designed and evaluated in the setting of industrialized countries. In countries that have inadequate drainage systems and poor road infrastructure, rainfall does not runoff effectively and causes immense flooding in prolonged rain periods. Hence, flooding has proven to have a substantial impact on road infrastructure as extreme and prolonged rains become a regular occurrence. As such, this research proposes a traffic model that incorporates the aforementioned weather variables present in Manila, and other features that describes the trends in traffic and weather for both normal and disrupted periods, to predict the current traffic condition intensity. From the data used, it was observed that traffic consists mostly of instances of \textit{light} and \textit{moderate} traffic. It was also observed that weather, especially an abundance of precipitation, can disrupt the normal trend of traffic. It was also observed that weather has a weak correlation with traffic. From such findings, features were selected and engineered in order to generate a set of features for the model that contribute in predicting traffic. Models that could predict traffic-based, weather-based, and fusion of the two at feature and decision levels were implemented using DBN. Evaluating the models shows that predicting traffic-based traffic prediction outperforms predicting weather-based traffic prediction. Moreover, the model that fuses traffic-based and weather-based predictions perform better than fusing weather and traffic to generate a prediction.
